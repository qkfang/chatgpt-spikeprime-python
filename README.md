# Build a Chatbot with Custom Spike Prime Knowledge

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a custom chatbot that leverages **Spike Prime knowledge** and serves as a starting point to create a personalized knowledge base for GPT models. From gathering raw documents (such as web pages) to processing them into JSON, this project will teach you how to design, structure, and fine-tune chatbot responses using **prompt engineering** techniques. 

The goal is to empower both technical and non-technical users to build custom chatbots using **OpenAI** or **Azure AI Studio**.


## üöÄ Features

- **Custom Knowledge Base Creation:** Learn how to collect raw documents (e.g., web pages) and transform them into structured JSON data.
- **Python Data Processing:** Use Python scripts to parse and process raw documents efficiently.
- **Prompt Engineering Techniques:** Master how to control chatbot responses using the **system message**.
- **Non-Technical Friendly:** Simple enough for non-technical users to deploy a chatbot on **OpenAI** or **Azure AI Studio**.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Keep building, tuning, and updating the chatbot‚Äôs data to improve performance over time.

## üîß Requirements

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Markdown and JSON formatting

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spike-prime-chatbot.git
   cd spike-prime-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Data:**
   - Collect raw documents (web pages, PDFs, etc.).
   - Use the provided Python script (`parse_documents.py`) to convert them into structured JSON.

## üõ† Usage

1. **Processing Documents:**
   Use the following command to parse and structure your documents:
   ```bash
   python parse_documents.py --input <your_raw_documents> --output data.json
   ```

2. **Configure Prompt Engineering:**
   Modify the `system_message` parameter in the chatbot‚Äôs configuration to customize the way responses are generated.

3. **Deploy on OpenAI or Azure AI Studio:**
   - Use **OpenAI**: Create a new chatbot, upload your custom data, and set your prompt configurations.
   - Use **Azure AI Studio**: Follow the instructions to integrate your chatbot and JSON data into Azure‚Äôs platform.

## üí° Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Set the system message:** This is crucial for controlling the tone, scope, and behavior of the chatbot.
   ```json
   {
     "system_message": "You are a helpful assistant specialized in Spike Prime knowledge."
   }
   ```

- **Experiment with instructions:** Adjust the prompt to refine the chatbot's responses based on user needs.

- **Iterate on feedback:** Regularly update the knowledge base with new information to continuously improve the chatbot's effectiveness.
